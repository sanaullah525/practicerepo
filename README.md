Hi, Iâ€™m @sanaullahkhan
This is my practice repository for learning python and practice Git and github.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about Data Analysis, DevOps, and AIOps.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data analytics, MS Excel, Power BI, SQL, R, Cloud and DevOps practices.

ðŸ“‚ I enjoy building projects that connect data insights with automation and operations.

I have reinstalled vs code after I faced crashed in VS code.
