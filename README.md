Author: Sanaullah Khan

Hi, I’m @sanaullahkhan
This is my practice repository for learning python and practice Git and github.

👀 I’m passionate about Data Analysis, DevOps, and AIOps.

🌱 I’m currently learning Excel, Power BI, SQL, R, and DevOps practices.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with data analysts, DevOps engineers, and programmers.

📂 I enjoy building projects that connect data insights with automation and operations.

I have reinstalled vs code after I faced crashed in VS code.
